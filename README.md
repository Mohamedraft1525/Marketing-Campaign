Income Distribution and Data Analysis Project
This project is an analysis of income distribution using various data visualization and statistical methods. The aim is to uncover insights about income patterns, identify any potential outliers, and provide a deeper understanding of the data.

The project uses Python and several libraries popular in the data science community, focusing on both data preprocessing and detailed visual analysis.

Project Overview
This project covers:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing or incomplete data to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
Descriptive Statistics: Providing summaries of the data, including measures of central tendency and variability.
Data Visualization: Utilizing interactive and static visual tools to display the distribution of income and other key variables.
Outlier Detection: Applying the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect and analyze income outliers.
Campaign Analysis: Exploring the relationship between customer behavior (i.e., acceptance of campaigns) and other demographic variables like marital status and living conditions.
Features
Visualizes the distribution of income, providing a clear view of how income is spread across the dataset.
Identifies and highlights outliers, allowing for deeper analysis of extreme data points.
Creates a new feature to categorize customers based on their living status derived from marital status.
Aggregates the number of marketing campaigns accepted by each customer, helping to uncover patterns in campaign engagement.
Libraries and Tools
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Plotly: Utilized for creating interactive data visualizations.
Matplotlib: Helps with static visual plots.
Missingno: Used for missing data visualization.
How to Access the Project
Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.
You can run the analysis either in a Jupyter Notebook or directly in Google Colab.
A direct link to the project in Google Colab is also available for easy access and execution of the notebook.

Insights and Takeaways
Through visualizing income distribution and analyzing customer behavior, this project provides valuable insights into how income is distributed and how customer engagement with marketing campaigns can be influenced by factors such as marital status and living arrangements.
